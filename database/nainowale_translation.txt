The eyes have... oh...
The eyes have stirred the cup of my heart
The honey-house has spilled
My peace of mind, the eyes have taken away with them

The eyes of the one who has eyes has aha ...
The eyes of the one who has eyes
The eyes of the one who has eyes has aha ...
The eyes of the one who has eyes
The eyes of the one who has eyes have touched the cup of my mind
The wine house was splashed
My night eyes took my peace away

I stagger, stagger, I stagger, I stagger
I stagger, stagger, I stagger, I stagger
Your eyes burn like a flickering flame, what a madness
I tremble, tremble, I tremble, I tremble
I hide from your pain
Like a snake on sandalwood
I am unconscious, you are the intoxication
Such a state of infatuation
Has taken away my peace of mind

The person with eyes, aha
The person with eyes
The person with eyes stirred the cup of my heart
And sprinkled the wine house
My peace and night eyes took away with them.
